# toneapi_webclient

Tone is an API that allows Northstar players to track their kill statistics : toneapi.github.io/ToneAPI_webclient/

If you want your server to appear on this website, you can download the server side mod from (here)[https://github.com/ToneAPI/ToneAPI_servermod]

The server side mod will send kills data to Tone API, which will then process them.

You will have to set a personal token for the mod to work, please ask me for one on Discord

Alternatively, you can selfhost your own backend (here)[https://github.com/ToneAPI/ToneAPI_backend]
